pipeline
	0 - fetch output        => decode
	1 - latched in rename   => assign bak{abx}
	2 - latched in mux      => decode stations
	3 - shifted into r_fast => issue (wake-up+select)
	    potentially register r_pending and use speculative wake-up
	4 - r_schedule          => select bak{abx} && decode regfile mux
            potentially register bak{abx}
	5 - m10k reg input      => mux m10k output and bypass
        6 - r_reg[ab] in EU     => execute	address decode
	7 -                        execute	L1 fetch + TLB-way select + L1 matrix
	8 -                        execute	rotate data => way-mux

probably a 10 stage pipeline once fetch works
