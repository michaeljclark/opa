regfile - use load-enable to mux between bypass/memory

renamer - if optimizing copies: leave them in place for commit to see

-- For memory unit (later):
-- B+W are always in-order
-- R is allowed to commute freely, EXCEPT:
-- it may only skip at most 'x' Ws

-- Assumption: reads are side-effect free (even on devices!)
-- Write-through cache ... want spills to be hot
-- reads specify if they can be cached and how far they commute
-- ... how does this interact with calling ABI? (callee/caller-saved)

decode - put aux into MLAB/M9k 
  just a single writer that puts all the stuff in for all ops at once
  put a reference into the renamer
  just need EU* copies of the memory and pull it 1st step of regfile 
   (must be a register when it reaches EU)
  => can help with using 64-bit wide immediates
